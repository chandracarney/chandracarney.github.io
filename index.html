<h2>
  About
</h2>
<p>
  I build proactive accessibility programs; I consult with companies on accessibility strategy, from overarching guidance to granular implementation.
</p>
<p>
  I hold <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional">IAAP CPACC</a>, a certification only obtained by a few thousand accessibility professionals globally.
</p>

<h2>
  Hire me
</h2>
<p>
  I implement accessibility practices and processes in every stage of the software development lifecycle. I build out accessibility practices at companies by working with them to assess their state of accessibility, recommending key gaps to fill, building a strategy, and getting to work.
</p>
<p>
  Some of my work has included training and coaching leaders (or teams) on accessibility, introducing accessibility across functions, reviewing designs and prototypes for issues, helping teams import and organize audits, and writing documentation.

  My work
</h2>
<p>
  At The New York Times, Etsy, and Aetna Digital, I launched and led company-wide accessibility efforts along with new accessibility teams, coaching cross-functional leaders and changing processes to guide product teams towards building products that are accessible, by design.
</p>
<p>
  I have also led teams to modernize systems and strategize on accessibility at <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5436">Veterans Affairs</a> and <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/case-studies/cloud-infrastructure-in-the-federal-government.html">Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a>.

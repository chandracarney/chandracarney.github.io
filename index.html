  I pitch and build accessibility programs. At Etsy I lead teams to build products that are accessible, by design. I have also led teams to modernize systems at the Veterans Affairs, Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and Aetna.
</p>

<p>I speak about accessibility in tech, among other topics. Most recently I have spoken at
  Parsons School of Design,

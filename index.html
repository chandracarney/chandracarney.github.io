<h2>
  About
</h2>
<p>
  I consult with companies on accessibility strategy; I pitch and build proactive accessibility programs.
</p>

<p>
  At both Etsy and Aetna Digital I led the company's accessibility efforts, coaching cross-functional leaders and team members, along with changing processes to guide teams towards building products that are accessible, by design. I have also led teams to modernize systems and strategize on accessibility at <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5436">Veterans Affairs</a> and <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/case-studies/cloud-infrastructure-in-the-federal-government.html">Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a>.

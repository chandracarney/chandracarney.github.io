<p>
  I graduated <a href="http://turing.io">Turing School</a>,
  a seven-month program to learn Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, TDD, client-side development in JavaScript, and more.
</p>

<p>I spoke at
  <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-how-to-program-with-accessibility-in-mind">RailsConf 2015</a>,
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/fullstack/">Denver Full Stack Meetup</a>, and
  <a href="http://a11ynyc.com/camp/">Accessibility Camp NYC</a>
  about accessibility on the web.
</p>

<p>
  I am looking for work as a developer with a focus on accessibility.

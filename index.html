<p>
  I am a Rails developer with a specialization in accessibility (web, art, museums, and other forms).
</p>

<p>I spoke at
  <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-how-to-program-with-accessibility-in-mind">RailsConf 2015</a>,
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/fullstack/">Denver Full Stack Meetup</a>, and
  <a href="http://a11ynyc.com/camp/">Accessibility Camp NYC</a>
  about accessibility on the web.

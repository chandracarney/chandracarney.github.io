  About
</h2>
<p>
  I consult with companies on accessibility strategy; I pitch and build proactive accessibility programs.
</p>

<p>
  I hold <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional">IAAP CPACC</a>, a certification only obtained by a few thousand accessibility professionals globally.
</p>

<p>
  At The New York Times, Etsy, and Aetna Digital, I launched and led company-wide accessibility efforts along with new accessibility teams, coaching cross-functional leaders and changing processes to guide product teams towards building products that are accessible, by design.
</p>

<p>I have also led teams to modernize systems and strategize on accessibility at <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5436">Veterans Affairs</a> and <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/case-studies/cloud-infrastructure-in-the-federal-government.html">Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services</a>.</p>

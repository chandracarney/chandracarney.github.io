  I recently graduated
  <a href="http://turing.io">Turing School</a>,
  a seven month program to learn technologies like Ruby, Rails,
  JavaScript, and more.

<p>I spoke at
  <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-how-to-program-with-accessibility-in-mind">RailsConf 2015</a>
  about accessibility on the web.
